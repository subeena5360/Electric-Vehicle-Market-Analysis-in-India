Electric Vehicle Market in India Market Segmentation
Abstract
Market segmentation is a vital approach for promoting the widespread adoption of emerging transportation technologies, such as electric vehicles (EVs), in developing markets. With EVs gaining traction as low-emission and cost-effective alternatives, their adoption is anticipated to grow significantly in the near future, sparking heightened academic interest. This study aims to identify and analyze potential buyer segments for EVs by examining psychographic, behavioral, and socio-economic factors through a structured research framework, integrating concepts of perceived benefits, attitudes, and purchase intentions.
A combination of advanced analytical techniques, including cluster analysis, multiple discriminant analysis, and Chi-square tests, was employed on survey data collected from 563 respondents via an online cross-sectional survey. The analysis revealed three distinct consumer segments: Conservatives, Indifferents, and Enthusiasts, which represent the early adopter demographics of EVs. The findings offer actionable insights for researchers and policymakers, providing strategic guidance to foster EV adoption within the context of sustainable transportation development.
This report utilizes Fermi Estimation to address the problem systematically by breaking it into manageable components for detailed analysis.
Keywords: Electric vehicles, Market segmentation, Sustainable transportation, Behavioral analysis, Adoption intention, Psychographics.
